[16:32:37.124] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 是的！这绝对是一个与古人有关的能量信号。它来自非常接近你的位置。
[16:33:03.265] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 这扇门有密封锁定机制，应该会对爆炸力反应灵敏。如果你能弄到炸弹或其他爆炸物，你也许可以打开这扇门。
[16:34:28.446] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 我猜这里的殖民者一定遇到了什么不愉快的事情。一次像这样的发现可能值数百万像素，而没有新殖民地会错过这些收入。

[16:39:26.167] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 这扇门好像是锁着的。也许在洞穴的其他地方搜索会发现某种开关。
[16:40:42.235] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 为了到达目标点，你需要找到一种方法让自己变得更小。也许在这个洞穴的其他地方有答案。我打赌这是个秘密！哦，小伙子！我爱秘密！
[16:41:10.692] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 我敢断定这里没人活着。我没有发现最近活动的痕迹。我估摸着这里大概已经有十年无人踏足了。
[16:42:19.568] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 你需要一些攀爬绳来到达那里，除非你特别灵活。试着找到一些绳子，或者在你的制造菜单[C]制造一些吧。
[16:43:08.927] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 嗯。 这扇门看起来密封得很好。哦！它上面有一个整洁的小导弹图标！也许某种爆炸力可以打开它？手榴弹、炸弹或火箭应该可以解决这道难题。
[16:43:23.080] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 哇哦。近乎完美的古人科技！这是一个非常有价值的发现。
[16:47:25.000] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 一个美丽的洞穴。这里的水看起来很清爽。游泳可能正是你所需要的，但要小心水面下的捕食者。
[16:48:43.642] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 这个开关看起来是一个定时触发器。如果你想通过这里，你可能需要提高你的移动速度，或者你所属的种族拥有极快的速度。冲刺科技可能会提供一些帮助。
[16:50:21.211] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 我想两个发光的标志都代表‘开启’，那么？最有道理的做法似乎就是——激活正确的控制台然后打打打打打开门！不是芝麻开门！就者是致命陷阱。
[16:52:10.392] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 为了进入这个地方，你将不得不进行一次跳跃，然后在空中按[F]
[16:53:43.861] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> 基于你的游戏时长，你已经获得了+3研究点数如果你处于挂机状态，这个增益将被取消。.
[16:56:51.730] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 这个洞穴里的能量信号很不寻常。我得到了明确的古代精华的痕迹读数，虽说这没什么意义。因为古人在这个星区没有存在历史记载。
[16:57:02.057] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 根据生命信号，你似乎无意中发现了某种巢穴。 注意：检测到大型突变体。
