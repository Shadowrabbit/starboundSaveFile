[19:10:18.434] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 看起来我的出现很是及时，你的FTL引擎已经毁坏了，而你的推动引擎基本上也彻底失效了。你的传送器也炸了。每次使用都会增加灾难性故障的风险。

[19:10:41.105] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 要想离开这个星球，你需要修理你的飞船。但是，让我们从小事开始：在地质学研究树中研究如何制造熔炉。然后制作一座熔炉！

[19:11:03.509] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 为什么不拿上我闲置的这把备用矿镐呢？ 它应该可以帮助您更快地挖掘，节省一点时间。不用努力多久，你就能用上高级工具了。
[19:11:25.909] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 第一步完成！请使用你的熔炉将矿石熔炼成锭。接下来，请在农业研究中研究如何在建立采集工作台，并制造一张。
[19:11:48.122] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 采集工作站能帮助你生存和耕作。你已经证明自己的能力，所以请继续努力，研究如何制作加工台制造一张。你会在工程学研究树中找到它。
[19:12:10.967] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 棒极了！接下来，你需要在你的加工台制造一些铜线。有了它我就能对你的传送器进行应急修理。它的缓冲器被注册为降级的，而这不是最佳状态。
[19:12:33.564] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 还差一步就能修好你的传送器：一个电磁铁。如果你不介意，就在你的加工台为我制作一个吧？
[19:12:55.555] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 我现在可以帮你修复你的飞船传送器。它应该不再有17.3%的几率会干扰你的DNA！现在你需要找到一个足够强大的能量源来组装一个新的STL引擎，以使你的飞船能够再次触及太空旅行。
[19:13:18.683] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 现在，让我们看看你的行头？ 虽然那里不会特别危险，但要确保至少通过装甲和武器研究树制造军备作坊。你会需要装甲和武器的。
[19:13:41.104] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 你问什么？ 这个星球的地表上有一处我进不去的黑暗洞穴，我先前曾检测到来自这里面的奇怪的读数，它们足够强大，其源头或许能够提供让你离开这个世界的能量源。

[19:25:34.993] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 这个洞穴里的能量信号很不寻常。我得到了明确的古代精华的痕迹读数，虽说这没什么意义。因为古人在这个星区没有存在历史记载。
[19:25:45.715] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 不过...这读数读起来像是古人，我几乎可以肯定。如果这些读数是准确的，我们真就在偶然间发现了一些真正重要的东西。坚持住！这是一个难得的发现真相的机会
[19:25:55.650] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 是的！这绝对是一个与古人有关的能量信号。它来自非常接近你的位置。
[19:26:04.976] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 这扇门有密封锁定机制，应该会对爆炸力反应灵敏。如果你能弄到炸弹或其他爆炸物，你也许可以打开这扇门。
[19:26:36.254] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 我猜这里的殖民者一定遇到了什么不愉快的事情。一次像这样的发现可能值数百万像素，而没有新殖民地会错过这些收入。
[19:26:59.299] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 这扇门好像是锁着的。也许在洞穴的其他地方搜索会发现某种开关。
[19:27:14.924] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 为了到达目标点，你需要找到一种方法让自己变得更小。也许在这个洞穴的其他地方有答案。我打赌这是个秘密！哦，小伙子！我爱秘密！
[19:27:26.951] [Info] Chat: <维纳利斯> 根据生命信号，你似乎无意中发现了某种巢穴。 注意：检测到大型突变体。
[19:28:51.820] [Info] Chat: <???> 如果你收到了这条信息，那么你一定是在古代传送门附近——请启动它来找到我。你可以用星核碎片和一个三度仪来激活传送门。
[19:29:00.894] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> 似乎你已经成功激活了星门，又有一条信息传过来了。

[19:30:59.919] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> 欢迎来到你的机械培训课程！你可以按[E]进入或退出机甲。若进入机甲后无法操作，请退出任务并重新进入。

[19:31:14.826] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> 你的机甲可以按[DOWN]进行躲避，或者[双击方向键]朝你走的方向冲刺。
[19:31:22.197] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> 如果需要的话，你的机甲将自动蹲伏，以适应它可以通过的狭小空间。例如在这一段设施的顶部。
[19:31:29.668] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> 在有重力的环境下，你的机甲会切换为地面移动模式。你可以手动双击 [上] 方向键切换地面模式为飞行模式，甚至在星球上也可以这么做。立即执行以继续。
[19:31:37.556] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> 请注意你的机甲的燃料储备和耐久，两者分别可视化为机甲上方的彩色条。随着时间的推移，燃料条会耗尽，当机甲受到伤害时，耐久条会被损耗。
[19:31:45.327] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> 你正悬浮在零重力环境。你正在驾驶的机甲设计用于太空旅行，我强烈建议你当前不要尝试退出载具。
[19:31:52.820] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> 这些目标可以被机甲的初始武器破坏。我的概率矩阵得出结论，破坏这些目标有助于你升级设备。
[19:32:00.276] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> 零重力战斗要比平地上的更为棘手。精度是至关重要的，因此你需要学会正确引导你的目标。

[19:32:07.691] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> 机甲在重力环境下会切换为陆地行走配置，我建议你继续前进。
[19:32:14.937] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> 请记住，你可以在你的改造台制作机甲修理工具并使用你的三度仪的升级菜单对其进行升级，使之更加有效。
[19:32:22.474] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> 敌对实体也存在于零重力环境中。我的宇航员记录显示，击败它们可能会得到一个厄尔吉斯电池，你的机甲可以吸收这个电池来补充耐久和燃料。
[19:32:30.233] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> 现在试着把这些杂碎清理掉。试着跳跃和践踏前方的生物。
[19:32:37.449] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> 机甲太大，无法通过该区域。按E进入和退出机甲，我建议你步行前进。
[19:32:44.743] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> 三度仪可以帮助你对你的机甲更换装备和加油。燃料很重要，所以保持机甲燃料充足。任务之后请在三度仪里面检查相应的按钮 (如果你看到“unauthorized user”，请重新开始任务。)。
[19:32:52.965] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> 你似乎通过了阿卡基博士的测试航线。我必须声明我很好奇关于这么大的一艘飞船被废弃原因，但是我的记录目前没有任何结果。
